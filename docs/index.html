<h1>Workshop: A Practical Introduction to Debugging</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>


<p>This workshop is designed for beginners.  We will introduce participants to tools useful in debugging computer programs.  We will use 
the command line tool <b>GDB<\b> and provide interactive examples to get you started.  We will also introduce you to memory debugging with 
<b>valgrind<\b> and discuss options for debugging computer programs that utilize parallel processing.</p>

<h2>Requirement</h2>
<ol>
  <li>To install the required software, please follow the instructions at the bottom of the page.
  <li>Some prior knowledge of coding with C/C++/Fortran is recommended but not requitred.
</ol>



<h2>Learning Goals</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Familiarity with <b>GDB<\b> and its basic commands
  <li>Ability to use a debugger to investigate basic issues in a computer program
  <li>How to use <b>valgrind<\b> to investigate memory leaks
  <li>Potential approaches to debugging programs built for parallel architecture
</ol>

<h2>Topics Covered</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Basic commands with GDB
  <li>Memory debugging with valgrind
  <li>Additional commands and features of GDB
  <li>Approaches to parallel debugging
</ul>

  Below are some brief instructions for installing GDB (if necessary) for various OS.

**Linux:**   
- GDB should come installed as a standard package on your system.  Check to see if it is installed by typing `gdb --v`.
- If you don't already have it, you should be able to install it using your package manager or from https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/download/.
  
**Mac:**   
- First open your terminal and install the Brew package manager by typing `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`.
- Use Brew to install the GDB application: `brew install gdb`
- To check the installation, type `gdb --v` and you'll see the software version if the installation was successful.
  
**Windows:**   
- The simplest way to install GDB is within MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows). Clicking the following link will start the download: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download
- Complete the MinGW installation in the usual Windows fashion. The default settings should be sufficient.
- A Graphical User Interface (GUI) should automatically pop up. If not, navigate to `C:\MinGW\libexec\mingw-get\guimain.exe` and execute the program. This should bring up the GUI window.
- Use the GUI to install the "mingw32-gbd bin" package. Click on the box to mark it for installation.
- To complete the installation, click on `Installation` &rarr; `Apply Changes`, then click on `Apply` in the resulting window.
- Open the Windows command prompt by searching for `cmd`
- To open the GDB program, type into the command prompt: `c:\mingw\bin\gdb.exe`
- _You may get an error if you are missing any libraries or dependencies. For example, a possible error is the lack of a gcc compiler. To fix this, simply search for a package that seems reasonable, such as "mingw32-gcc" and install it._
