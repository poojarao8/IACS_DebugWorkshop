<h1>Workshop: A Practical Introduction to Debugging</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>


<p>This workshop is designed for beginners.  We will introduce participants to tools useful in debugging computer programs.  We will use 
the command line tool <b>GDB<\b> and provide interactive examples to get you started.  We will also introduce you to memory debugging with 
<b>valgrind<\b> and discuss options for debugging computer programs that utilize parallel processing.</p>

<h2>Requirement</h2>
<ol>
  <li>To install the required software, please follow the instructions at the bottom of the page.
  <li>Some prior knowledge of coding with C/C++/Fortran is recommended but not requitred.
</ol>



<h2>Learning Goals</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Familiarity with <b>GDB<\b> and its basic commands
  <li>Ability to use a debugger to investigate basic issues in a computer program
  <li>How to use <b>valgrind<\b> to investigate memory leaks
  <li>Potential approaches to debugging programs built for parallel architecture
</ol>

<h2>Topics Covered</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Basic commands with GDB
  <li>Memory debugging with valgrind
  <li>Additional commands and features of GDB
  <li>Approaches to parallel debugging
</ul>
